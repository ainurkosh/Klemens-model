# Klemens-model applied to LiF thermal conductivity calculation.
The matlab code that calculates thermal conductivity of the material as a function of point defects.

The thermal transport degradation of lithium fluoride single crystals irradiated by 710 MeV Bi ions
at fluences ranging between 10^10 and 10^13 cmâˆ’2 was examined across two depths regions,
 on nanometer and micrometer scales, by picosecond time-domain thermoreflectance and modulated continuum
 wave thermoreflectance methods, respectively. The proliferation of swift heavy ion-induced structural
defects was characterized using optical absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies. 
Klemens thermal model was applied to correlate the concentrations of color
center defects to thermal conductivity reduction in irradiated LiF crystals.
